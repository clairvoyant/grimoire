MATRIX ORDER
In C, multidimensional arrays are indexed with the most rapidly changing index last: [k][j][i]. 
In Fortran arrays, the most rapidly changing index comes first: (i,j,k). 

The C and Fortran approachs are a transpose of the other.

    The matrix
        | 1 2 3 |
        | 4 5 6 |

    In C:
        int A[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
        offset = row*NUMCOLS + column


    In Fortran:
         1  4  2  5  3  6
         offset = row + column*NUMROWS
